# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Healthcare-Reviews
The primary objective of this project was to construct a model capable of accurately classifying sentiments expressed in healthcare reviews. This is a crucial task as it can provide insights into patient satisfaction and areas that require improvement.
Data Preprocessing: The initial step in this project was data preprocessing. This involved cleaning the healthcare reviews by eliminating unnecessary elements such as stop words, punctuation, and numbers. The text data was then normalized using techniques like stemming or lemmatization. These techniques reduce the complexity of the data by converting words to their base or root form. For instance, “running”, “runs”, and “ran” would all be reduced to the root word, “run”. This process simplifies the data and makes it easier for the model to understand.

Sentiment Analysis Model: After preprocessing the data, a sentiment analysis model was developed. A Logistic Regression model was used for this purpose. This model was trained using TF-IDF features, which were obtained from the preprocessed text. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic used to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.

Model Evaluation: After the model was trained, it was evaluated to determine its performance. This was done by splitting the data into a training set and a test set. The model was trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to quantify the model’s performance. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model’s performance, taking into account both the true positives and the false positives.

Insights & Visualization: The final step involved interpreting the results and visualizing them in a meaningful way. This could have involved creating plots to show the distribution of sentiments, or using word clouds to display the most common words associated with each sentiment. These visualizations provided valuable insights into the sentiments present in the healthcare reviews.

Conclusion: By completing these tasks, you’ve successfully developed a model that can analyze sentiments in healthcare reviews. This can be incredibly useful for understanding patient satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.Here the data set is duplicated hence the accuracy of the model is not taken into account I have done data cleaning and data preprocession of these nlp model
